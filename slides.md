# The Philosophy of Remix

<p></p>

<p v-click="1">

- Embrace the server/client model

</p>

<p v-click="3">

- Work with, not against, the foundations of the web: Browsers, HTTP, and HTML. Itâ€™s always been good and it's gotten really good in the last few years.

</p>  

<p v-click="4">

- Use JavaScript to augment the user experience by emulating browser behavior.

</p>

```js
export default function Gists() {
  const gists = useSomeFetchWrapper(
    "https://api.github.com/gists"

  if (!gists) {
    return <Skeleton />;
  }
  return (
